A turbomachinery varies the inlet guide vane (IGV) at a specific pressure to regulate the flow rate. 

The compressor performance map shows the IGV angle, flow rate, and power consumption of the compressor at a specific pressure. 

Based on the provided compressor performance map, the code derives a relationship between the IGV angle, flow rate, and power consumption at a specific pressure at each IGV angle by curve fitting, and then generates random numbers centered on the expression. This generates a large amount of random numbers that match the actual data trend.
